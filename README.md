# Guess The Number Game
# Description

This project is a simple number guessing game where the computer generates a random number from 1 to 100, and the player has to guess it. The program provides feedback to help the player adjust their guesses:

If the guess is too high, the program will display: __"Lower number please."__

If the guess is too low, the program will display: __"Higher number please."__

When the player correctly guesses the number, the program displays the number of attempts it took to arrive at the correct answer.




# How It Works
__1.__ The program uses Python's random module to generate a random number.

__2.__ The player inputs a guess.

__3.__ The program compares the guess with the generated number and provides feedback.

__4.__ This loop continues until the player guesses the correct number.

__5.__ Once the correct number is guessed, the program displays the total number of attempts made by the player.

# Requirements
__i.__ Python 3.x

__ii.__ No additional libraries are required as the program only uses Python's built-in random module.
# How to Run the Program
__1.__ Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

__2.__ Download or clone the project files to your local machine.

__3.__ Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the program file.

__4.__ Run the program using the command:
screentshot 

__5.__ Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

# Customization

__i.__ You can modify the range of the random number by changing the parameters in the random.randint() function.

__ii.__ The program can be expanded to include difficulty levels, where different ranges of numbers are used.
